# Linear Algebra 1 [20109]

**About.** This course is much more intensive than Ashnav. It deals with algebra different from school algebra.
The course is very abstract.


**My experience.** The course was the first hard-core math course I tackled. Compared to Ashnav's introductory attitude, in Linear Algebra 1 topics are quickly learned. It was hard and the assignments were long. It was nice to learn so many new concepts: linear spaces, linear operations, matrix arithmetic, etc. The material was more mature in explaining the concepts.



**Preliminaries.**  Ashanv's material on sets was an absolute savior for me. Furthermore, induction could have been helpful. Trigonometry at the 10th-grade level is recommended, yet not as crucial as Sets and Induction.

**Focus Suggestion.** The supplied learning material contains 'Preparation Chapters'. Don't read all of them before the semester and not at the beginning of the semester. Read it as you need it. The professors describe what preliminary is required for each chapter.

Many of the preparation chapters briefly teach material from Ashnav. The only one that isn't in Ashnav is the Binomial Theorem, which is taught in the Discrete Mathematics course. Learning it isn't a big deal, and the use of it isn't that vast.

**Personal Note.** In retrospect, I would have taken Discrete Mathematics before taking this course. I wasn't mature enough mathematically after Ashnav alone. Yet there's an advantage to my path.

Taking the course right after Ashnav threw a huge chunk of mature mathematics on my head. I quickly was acquainted with it, which made me pass Discrete Mathematics easily. The mediocre grade I got in Linear Algebra didn't have much impact, because I later improved it to perfection while gaining great mathematical maturity early in my journey.

This was the course that made me love Math, even more than programming. I felt angry for not earning a nice grade, as it didn't fit my affection for the material. It was only at the end of my degree that I retook the exam, and scored a 100. Doing a Moed B back then would have delayed my progress in the following semester, and the decision to postpone revisions was proven worthy. Thanks, Dad.
