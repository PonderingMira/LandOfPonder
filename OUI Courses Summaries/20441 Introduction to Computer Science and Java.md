# Introduction to Computer Science and Java [20441]

**About.** The course is the first programming course you take in OUI. It teaches the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Considered a hard course by students who didn't tackle programming prior to taking the course. Hard mostly because of the algorithmic part of it (the final chapters). Can be divided into two courses (one semester each).


**My experience.** I had experience with programming before taking the course. I built projects such as apps and websites and was familiar with Java. The course was fun, the assignments enjoyable, and I experienced a mature attitude from the course, unlike school computer science. There I really learned the concept of OOP. The algorithmic part was interesting and got it covered after much training. I remember helping other students along the semester -- many struggled with the course. The learning material was good. The course laid the basics for the next programming course, 'Lab in System Programming'.



**Preliminaries.** It's highly recommended to learn the basics of programming prior to taking the course. If you do have experience in programming, taking the one-semester course is reasonable. If you don't, I'd take the two-semester approach.

**Personal Note.** After gaining perspective, I realized that programming is nothing but a technical, Sisyphean activity. That is although my point of view during the beginning of my degree was the other way around. I liked the programming courses -- for which I started learning at OUI in the first place. That being said, it's important to know how to program, and this course meets its purpose.
