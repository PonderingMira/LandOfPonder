# Introduction to Mathematics ('Ashnav') [04101]

**About.** The 'Ashnav for Mathematics' course is the first to take by any teen in the Academia in Highschool program.
It lays the foundation for later mathematical courses. It assumes no previous knowledge and teaches basic concepts. It is known as an 'easy' course.
The quotations are here for a reason: the course isn't so easy for newcomers, which make the largest share of students taking it.


**My experience.** The course was interesting. The most astonishing concept to me was group theory and the equinumerousity between infinite sets.

I took the course in 8th grade, and it was challenging.
Before taking the course I didn't like math, and was a mediocre maths student at school.
I experienced a shift of mindset, moving from technical school mathematics to more abstract mathematics, and fell in love with the abstract kind of thought.



**Preliminaries.** The course is tailored for newcomers: the number of assignments required to be submitted is flexible,
and the exam lets you choose specific subjects to answer questions about (in my time it was 4/6).

It taught everything from the ground up, so the required prior knowledge isn't that vast.
Arithmetic is required: number manipulation. For example, factorizing a number as in $30=2\cdot 15=2\cdot 3\cdot 5$, and rules as $(2^{3})^{7}=2^{3\cdot 7}$.
 Not more than that.

**Focus Suggestion.** I didn't fully comprehend some of the learned concepts. 
Yet I did understand set theory, which is the most important concept learned in the course. 
That's because set theory is used all over the place, in maths and computer science courses alike.

Included is a list of subjects learned in the course, sorted by priority of understanding.

    1. Sets.
    2. Binary Operations.
    3. Functions.
    4. Chapter from Number Theory and Mathematical Induction.
    5. Axioms.
    6. Isometries.
    7. Euclidean Geometry.

**Personal Note.** Take it easy. 
University-level courses are hard and you must remember you are a newbie.
Remember you don't have to learn all of the topics to mastery, as you may choose only a part of them on the final exam.
 Prioritize the subjects you learn. Do as many assignments are possible and be prepared to get low grades.
 Feedback is your friend. Write the assignments on paper, don't waste time writing them on a computer. 
  Summer semester is quite short, especially for newbies -- you should prefer taking it in Autumn or Spring semester.
